### Description

In this 3-day workshop, you will learn about molecular pathway curation, pathway and network analysis, and how to automate such an analysis in R to increase reproducibility. We would like to bring together researchers in the COVID-19 field to learn together, exchange ideas and discuss results. The course is a continuous program and builds on each other but it is possible to join only on specific days if needed.


### Requirements and preparation
* Follow the [instructions](materials/Preparation_Instructions.md) to install all required software for the tutorial.
